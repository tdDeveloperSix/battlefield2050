    "paragraph1": "Imagine a fleet of autonomous vessels that suddenly appear off a nation's coast without warning. They communicate with no human command, but coordinate their movements through algorithms that can process thousands of variables per second. This is not science fiction - it is a realistic projection of what military operations might look like in a few decades.",
    "paragraph2": "The digital revolution of the battlefield is about the gradual transition from human to algorithmic decision-making in military contexts. It is the story of how artificial intelligence not only becomes a tool, but gradually takes over the role as the primary decision-maker on future battlefields.",
    "paragraph3": "Through six critical phases - from today's human-centered systems to 2050's completely autonomous war machines - we explore the technological, ethical, and strategic implications of this transformation. It is a journey that challenges our fundamental understanding of war, responsibility, and human control."
